# CLRO
It is a Calculator in Romanian language. It can do simple calculations such as "term1 operator term2" where the operators are the
arithmetic ones (+, -, *, /) and the terms are from 0 to 999.999.999. It can answer stuff like "What is the sum of 3 and fourteen"
 (but in Romanian language - "Cat este suma dintre 3 si paisprezece?") or "What's the result of multiplying ten and four thousand
 three hundred and nine?".
